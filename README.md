# Hot or Cold

1. make components
2. wrap them in react-redux

components
	- main container             a √

		- help && new game       b √

		- game container         a √

			- guess feedback     b √

			- input / submit     a √
				-submit should work with
				click and enter key
				-

			- guess count        b √

			- past guesses       a √

## Next steps:
1. testing
  - test components
  	- start page
  	- main container 
  	- help && new game 
	- game container
	- guess feedback 
	- input / submit  
	- guess count
	- past guesses
 
  - test redux
  	- state
  	- store 

2. start page
  - in state boolean value if start page is true or false
  - when game is loaded startpage: true
  - when range is selected startpage: false

modify range conditionals 
  - ranged conditionals based off of a percent of range
radio buttons
  - easy (num) medium (num) hard (num)


choose range
