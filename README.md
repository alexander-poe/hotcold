1. make components
2. wrap them in react-redux

components
	- main container             a √

		- help && new game       b √

		- game container         a √

			- guess feedback     b √

			- input / submit     a √

			- guess count        b √

			- past guesses       a √

## Next steps:
1. Create each of the components using dummy data, and update your Game component so they are rendered.
Each component should live in a separate file

- Wrap them in react-redux
